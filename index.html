      <h4>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why:</h4>

      My favorite cmsc subject is Computer Science 22. I really enjoyed programing
      in Java, because I learned to think and program in an Object oriented standpoint.
      Although at first I struggled, since Java has a confusing syntax and style. Unlike
      python, it was complex. However I really enjoyed that subject because of its exercises.
      I learned so much doing the exercises of that subject, especially the minesweeper exer.
      Studying OOP, will help me a lot when I would create try and create more and more complex
      projects, especially in game programming. I have an interest in game programming,
      and I realized just how vital OOP is, because when I imagined creating a game just like
      runescape without OOP, it will be almost impossible to keep track of things and the objects.
      Thats it for now.

      <h4>Favorite GE so far and why:</h4>

      My favorite Ge subject so far is Math 10. Before I entered college, math for me was just
      a boring subject with no significance to my development. However when I learned more about the it,
      I was amazed by the wonders of math, how we can find patterns in almost everything. From the
      patterns formed by the galaxies to the tiniest details of nature, we can always find patterns.
      Not only that learning math would help you improve your critical thinking skills. It also
      came into my mind that learnig more about math will help you in creating more advance and complex
      programs, like when you would like to create a universe knowing lots about mathematics can
      create a universe close to ours. Those are the reasons why my Ge subject is math 10, it made me
      realize the wonders of math and beauty of math.

      <h4>Favorite programming language so far and why:</h4>

      My favorite programming language so far is python, when I was still in high school the programming
      that I tried to learn with was python because the forums were always recommending python. Python is
      as we know is a very beginner friendly, as it can be interpreted just like normal language. It was very
      fun to learn python because I was able to create many simple programs such as ceasar cipher encoder and decoder
      and a few more encrypting techniques. The concepts I learned in python were easily transferable to other
      programming languages, which made learning other languages easy because all I had to was learn the syntax
      and style and ill be good. Not only that there were also lots of tutorials on the internet which made me like it
      even more.
